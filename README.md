# 🧠 Customer Analytics Project

This project focuses on customer behavior analysis to drive better decision-making and enhance marketing strategies. The workflow follows a full-stack analytical approach — starting from segmentation to advanced deep learning models for conversion prediction.

## 📁 Project Structure

1. **Segmentation**
   - Performed customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques.
   - Identified distinct customer groups based on behavioral and demographic features.
   - Visualized segments for better interpretability and actionable insights.

2. **Purchase Analytics**
   - **Purchase Intent Prediction**: Modeled whether a customer is likely to make a purchase.
   - **Product Recommendation**: Predicted which product a customer is most likely to buy.
   - **Purchase Quantity Modeling**: Estimated how much of a product a customer is likely to purchase using regression techniques.

3. **Conversion Prediction using Deep Learning**
   - Built and trained deep learning models to predict the probability of conversion.
   - Used neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships in customer behavior.
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Techniques**: Clustering, Classification, Regression, Deep Learning

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- Better understanding of different customer personas through segmentation.
- Improved targeting with predictive purchase intent models.
- Personalized recommendations for products and estimated quantities.
- Accurate prediction of conversion likelihood using neural networks.
